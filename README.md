# MEV-BOT

## Overview
Welcome to the **MEV BOT** GitHub repository! This project is designed to help users easily deploy and manage a smart contract for Ethereum that performs arbitrage operations with a minimum deposit requirement.

## Features
- **Easy to Use**: Simple deployment and management.
- **Secure**: Ensures a minimum deposit of 1 ETH.
- **Optimized**: Efficient use of gas and resources.

## Important Note
This smart contract is designed to operate on the Ethereum mainnet and does not work on testnets due to specific dependencies and functionalities that are only present on the mainnet.

## Installation

### Deploying with Remix IDE

1. Download [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/download.html) (if you don’t have it already)
   Access the  [**Remix IDE**](https://remix.ethereum.org)(this website is where we deploy the smart contract).

2. **Create a New File**:
   Click on the **File Explorers** tab, then click on **Create New File** and name it `MevBot.sol`.


3. **Copy the Contract Code**:
   [**Copy the entire contract code**](MevBot.sol) from this repository and paste it into `MevBot.sol`.

4. **Compile the Contract**:
   Click on the **Solidity Compiler** tab, select the appropriate compiler version 0.6.12, and click on **Compile MevBot.sol**.


5. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Click on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab.
   - Select `Injected Web3` as the environment to connect to MetaMask.
   - Ensure you are connected to the Ethereum mainnet in MetaMask.
   - Click on the **Deploy** button.

6. **Confirm Deployment**:
   Confirm the deployment transaction in MetaMask. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the gas fees and the minimum deposit requirement.

### Using the Contract

1. **Deposit ETH**:
   Ensure that the contract has at least 0.5 ETH deposited. You can send ETH to the contract address directly from your wallet.

2. **Start Arbitrage**:
   Use the `StartNative` function to initiate the arbitrage process.

3. **Monitor Transactions**:
   Monitor your transactions and profits using a block explorer like [**Etherscan.io**](https://etherscan.io/).

## Usage

### Start Arbitrage Operation
1. **Ensure sufficient funds**:
   We recommend funding the contract with at least 0.5-2 ETH or higher to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot targets to­ken c­ontr­a­cts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6% fees. If you fund the contract with less than recommended and the bot targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit.

2. **Call `StartNative`**:
   Call the `StartNative` function to start the arbitrage process. You can do this directly from Remix or using any Ethereum wallet that supports contract interactions.
